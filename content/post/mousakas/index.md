# Tools:

- Food processor
- Fine sieve
- Oven
- Parchment paper

# Execution:

## FOR THE STEAK:

- Place a pan on high heat and let it get very hot.
- Pat the steak with a paper towel until it’s completely dry on the outside.
- Season it well with salt and make sure it goes everywhere.
- Put enough oil to the pan to barely cover its bottom and add the steak.
- Sauté well from one side until a very brown crust starts forming then turn it.
- Wait until the other side starts getting a nice colour, then add the butter, garlic, oregano and rosemary to the pan.
- Tilt the pan and use a spoon to contiguously poor the melted aromatic butter over the rack. This is called arroser. Repeat for a couple of minutes.
- Continue doing this until the center of the steak reaches 52C.
- Remove the steak from the pan, place it in a container along with the garlic, oregano, rosemary and most of the butter, cover with aluminium foil and let rest - for at least 10 mins.

## FOR THE BÉCHAMEL:

- Add a small pot over medium-low heat.
- Add the butter and when it’s melted, add the flour.
- Stir well using the fouet and cook for a couple minutes.
- Start adding the milk in doses. When the mixture thickens add the next dose. There should be 3-4 doses in total.
- When the sauce is ready add the cumin and salt to adjust it to your liking.
- Keep the sauce warm until ready to use.

## FOR THE PURÉE:

- Preheat the oven to 180C.
- Put the eggplants in the oven and bake them until a fork pierces them with zero resistance (around 30-45 minutes).
- Cut them in half and use a spoon to remove all of the flesh and discard the skins. Then, cut them very finely with a knife.
- Put the eggplants in a sieve and let them strain off all their liquid. It will take around 15 minutes.
- Add the eggplants, garlic and a few touches of olive oil in a food processor and blend well for 5 minutes until the purée is very smooth.
- Adjust the consistency with adding more olive oil and the taste by adding balsamic vinegar and honey.
- Adjust the salt and store in a container.

## FOR THE POTATO CHIPS:

- Put a pot with oil on medium-high heat.
- Use a peeler to peel the potato and cut thin strips of it.
- Use a very small biscuit cutter or a water bottle cap to cut out small potato disks.
- Put the potato disks in a bowl with cold water, rinse them well, then dry them using a paper towel.
- Put the potato disks in the oil and fry them until golden brown.
- Put them in a container with a paper towel and salt them.

## FOR THE CHILI POWDER:

- Put the chilis in an oven set to 90C and bake until fully dehydrated (around 2 hours).
- Put the chilis in a food processor and blend well until they become a powder.

# Platting:

- Transfer the purée into a squeeze bottle.
- Make a big dot with the purée in the center of the plate.
- Carve the steak as to form two rectangles and place them on top of the purée.
- Make little dots with the béchamel on the plate.
- Place the potato chips unevenly on the plate as shown in the image above.
- Poor the chili powder on one side of the plate.
- Draw a line with the béchamel sauce on the side of the plate if you’re feeling extra fancy.

# Theory, tips:

- Although counter-intuitive the liquid that comes out of the baked aubergines is pure bitterness and it should be discarded. That’s why it is essential to strain the eggplants before blending them.
- For the chili powder, if you are living in a hot and dry environment you can hang the fresh chilis using twine and let them dehydrate naturally for a few days.
- To take the temperature of the meat, pierce it with the thermometer in its thickest part. In this case, place it at the center of the steak.
- The suggested order to prepare the different parts of the dish is: chili powder, purée, chips, béchamel, steak.
