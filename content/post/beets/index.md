- 30g olive oil
- sugar to taste
- salt to taste

## FOR THE YELLOW PEPPER SAUCE:

- 3 yellow bell peppers
- 300ml apple cider vinegar
- 30g olive oil
- sugar to taste
- salt to taste

## FOR THE WHITE CHOCOLATE SAUCE:

- 115g white chocolate
- 60g heavy cream (35% fat)
- 10g honey

## FOR THE BALSAMIC GLAZE:

- 100ml balsamic vinegar
- sugar to taste

# Tools:

- Pan
- Small pot
- Heatproof spatula
- Blender
- Fine sieve
- Oven
- Tin foil
- Heatproof bowl
- Round cookie cutter with a slightly smaller diameter than the beets
- Cleaning film

# Execution:

## FOR THE BEETS:

- Preheat the oven to 200C.
- Place each beet on a large piece of foil and sprinkle it with salt and olive oil.
- Wrap the foil very tightly and put the beets in the oven.
- Roast for 2 hours.
- When roasted, remove from the oven, unwrap them and let them cool down for 3 minutes.
- Cut the top and bottom of each beet as to create a thick disk.
- Use the cookie cutter to cut out the center of the beet.
- Store in a container until ready to use.

## FOR THE RED PEPPER SAUCE:

- Preheat the oven to 200C.
- Place the peppers in the oven and roast them until their skin is very dark and burned (around 30 mins).
- Put the peppers in a bowl and wrap it tightly with cleaning film.
- Let them steam for 10 minutes.
- Remove the cleaning film, rinse the peppers with some cold water and use your hands to remove their skin and seeds.
- Finely chop the peppers and place them in a cold pan.
- Add the vinegar and sugar and cook on medium heat until all the vinegar evaporates.
- Transfer into a blender with olive oil and blend until smooth.
- Adjust the consistency using ice-cold water. The sauce should be thick but still thin enough to pour, like a syrup.
- Pass the sauce through a fine sieve to remove the solids and store in a container.

## FOR THE YELLOW PEPPER SAUCE:

- Same as for the red one but with the yellow peppers.

## FOR THE WHITE CHOCOLATE GANACHE:

- Chop the chocolate into small pieces.
- Transfer it into a bowl with the honey.
- In a small pot heat the cream to 90C (just before boiling).
- Add the cream to the chocolate and stir slowly with a spatula until emulsified and shiny.
- Wrap with cleaning film (with the film touching the surface of the ganache) and store until ready to use.

## FOR THE BALSAMIC GLAZE:

- Add the balsamic vinegar in a pot over medium heat.
- Reduce to a glaze consistency.
- Adjust the taste with sugar.

# Platting:

- Add spoonfuls of the pepper sauces on the perimeter of the plate.
- Using a spoon hit the sauces to make them splatter around.
- Place the beet on the center of the plate.
- Make nice little lines with the ganache and the balsamic glaze.
- (Optional) Add some fleur de sel on top of the beet.

# Theory, tips:

- In my opinion this is the best way to cook beets as it removes the dirt-like taste of raw beets and gives them a deep nutty flavor instead.
- To make this recipe vegan omit the heavy cream in the ganache and just use melted white chocolate.
