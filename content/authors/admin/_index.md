I'm a software engineer at Google, I've built an AI startup with tens of thousands of users for which I was included in the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, and I've worked at major tech companies like Amazon, Oracle, and Bloomberg.

Besides work I'm very passionate about cooking so I decided to also post some recipes that I created!
